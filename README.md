# EMG-Decomposition
MATLAB code that takes an EMG signal as input and realizes a complete EMG decomposition of the signal.

• The code was optimized to find the maximum number of neurons involved in the EMG signal.

• The code outputs the plots for each step: filtering of the signal, spikes detection, spikes alignment, scatterplot (extracted features using PCA), spikes clustering and spikes classification. 

• I used different methods to improve the results: differentiate the signal and Nonlinear Energy Operator (NEO) based spike detection for a better threshold.
